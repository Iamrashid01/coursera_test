                <h2>Ectomorph</h2>
                <p>
            “Ectomorphs are generally tall and lean. They have very little body fat and very little muscle tone. They have smaller, more delicate features, narrow shoulders and find it very hard to gain weight.
            Ectomorph females generally have flat chests and both male and female ectomorphs have flat bottoms.
            These body types generally have a rectangular appearance and lack curves or definition. Ectomorphs have very high metabolisms, which is why they have difficulty gaining and maintaining body weight. ”

                <h2>Mesomorph</h2>
                <p>
                    “Mesomorph refers to body types with a naturally high muscle-to-fat ratio. People with this body type typically respond well to weight training, finding it easier than other people to build and maintain muscle. They may also find it easier to gain or lose weight.”

                <h2>Endomorph</h2>
                <p>
                “People with an endomorph body type tend to have a slow metabolism, making it easier for them to gain weight and harder for them to lose it. This also stunts muscle growth. However, following a specific diet and exercise plan can often help people with endomorphic bodies meet and maintain their health goals.”
